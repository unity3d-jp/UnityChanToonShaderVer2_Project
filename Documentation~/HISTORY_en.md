# Release History of UTS2
## Version
### 2019/05/22: 2.0.7 Release: Fixed release version 5
* Fixed Version 4 has been discarded and a new "the problem of incorrect display of the image outline reflected in the mirror object when Z-Offset is specified in the outline" has been corrected.  
* Added "_Is_LightColor_Outline" to make light color react to outline color. From the custom GUI, the function can be turned on by setting "Outline" button to "Active" from "LightColor Contribution to Materials" menu. In the case of the outline, there are some specification restrictions on the reaction to the light color, so please refer to the manual for details.  

### 2019/05/15: 2.0.7 Release: Fixed release version 4
* When Z-Offset is specified for the outline, the problem of incorrect display of the outline of the image reflected in the mirror object has been alleviated.  

### 2019 05/10: 2.0.7 Release: Fixed release version 3
* Added a new sample scene for testing(Mirror/MirrorTest.unity).

* The following new features have been added.  

#### New Features  
* Added 'Remove Unused Keywords/Properties from Material` button to Option Menu in Basic Shader Settings.  
By executing this function, unnecessary shader keywords and unused property values in the UTS2 material can be removed.  
Applying this when publishing a project, especially just before uploading avatars to VRChat, can reduce the unnecessary load on the system.  
This function was developed based on the Issue #18 of ACiiL TwitterID: @__aciil's .

### 2019/03/23: 2.0.7 Release: Release version  
* The following new features have been added.

### 2019/02/28: 2.0.6 Release: Fixed release version
* We re-adjusted the design of "UTS2 Custom Inspector". Together we updated the manual as well.  

### 2019/02/21: 2.0.6 Release: Release version  
* Added following bug fixes and new features.  

#### New UI installed
* ShaderGUI based user interface "UTS 2 custom inspector" was installed. The manual has also been updated and redesigned.  

#### Bug Fix  
* Fixed that the rimlight was not reflected when the blend mode of MatCap was multiplying (Is_BlendAddToMatCap = OFF).  
* When the color blend mode of MatCap is multiplication (Is_BlendAddToMatCap = OFF), the order of shadow masks was incorrect was corrected.  
* Fine adjustment of surface judgment of outline mode / position scaling method.  

#### New Features  
* The new feature "Activate Camera Rolling_Stabilizer" which suppresses rotation of MatCap against the rolling of the camera was carried. This function was realized by Contribution of TwitterID: @ShowBuyS.  
* The new feature "Blur Level of MatCap_Sampler" based on Mip Map has been added to MatCap_Sampler.  
* The new function "Inverse_MatcapMask" to invert texture for MatcapMask was added.  
* The ShadingGradeMap function has been enhanced. In addition to adding "Tweak_ShadingGradeMapLevel" for level correction, "Blur Level of ShadingGradeMap" based on Mip Map has been added.  

#### Enhancements  
* Enhanced the Tweak_SystemShadowsLevel function to adapt to receive shadows and shading with system shadows.  
* When "PointLights HiCut_Filter (ForwardAdd Only) = OFF", high color is added to real time point light.  
* In addition to making the properties of tessellation shaders easy to use, "DX 11 Tess: Extrusion Amount" was made slidable for easy adjustment.  
* Improved the GI_Intensity to set the strength of GI. If you want GI to reflect on UTS2 material, please first set "GI_Intensity = 1". It is reflected at almost the same brightness as Standard Shader.  
* Bump scale added to normal map.  
* Depth buffer write processing has been added to Transparent shaders.  

#### Change  
* The maximum value of Unlit_Intensity has been changed from 2 to 4.
