## HDRP AOV

compatibility with [HDRP Arbitrary Output Variables(AOV)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@14.0/manual/AOVs.html) is added to the **Unity Toon Shader**, which makes it possible to record Beauty, Albedo, Normal and other AOV sequential images using [Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.recorder@4.0/manual/index.html) later than 3.0.

When using HDRP AOV, [Outline](Outline.md) needs to be desabled. Please, refer to [Known Issues](Known-issue.md).
