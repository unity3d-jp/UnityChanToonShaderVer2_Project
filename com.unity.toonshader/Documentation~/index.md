The **Unity Toon Shader** (UTS3) is a set of toon shaders designed to meet the needs of creators working on cel-shaded 3D-CG animations. 

The **Unity Toon Shader** is compatible with all the render pipelines, the **Built-in Render Pipeline**, the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** and the **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)**, though, there are some differences in the features supported by different render pipelines. Please refer to the Feature difference for each render pipeline for details in [Feature Difference](FeatureModel_en.md).

**Unity Toon Shader** is  the successor of **Unity-chan Toon Shader ver 2.0 (UTS2)**, which was popular for years in games and animations. but, UTS2 was solely for the **Built-in Render Pipeline**.

The **Unity Toon Shader** allows  users to specify the colors of light and shadow. These features are essential for cel-shaded character designs. 

Three basic colors, **base color**, **1st shading color**, and **2nd shading color**, play a key role in character design in the **Unity Toon Shader**. Please, refer to [Three Color Map and Control Map Settings](Basic.md).

Besides the three basic colors, the **Unity Toon Shader** provides wide variety of features such as [Highlight](Highlight.md), [Rim Light](Rimlight.md), [Emission](Emission.md), [Angel Ring](AngelRing.md), [Material Capture(MatCap)](MatCap.md) and some special maps.
